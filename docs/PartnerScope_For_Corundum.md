# PartnerScope for Corundum Corp.

**Reducing Partner Discovery from Weeks to Minutes**

---

## The Bottleneck

Corundum Corp. has spent a decade building expertise in open innovation and venture building. Your team excels at turning early-stage technologies into real businesses through strategic partnerships.

But partner discovery remains a bottleneck:

> *"Corundum Corp. has a customer (e.g. startup) with a business idea, and needs to assist them with finding business partners such as investors, technology providers, or manufacturers. How can they do this in the best way?"*

**Current baseline:**

| Per Customer | |
|:-------------|:------------|
| Hours spent | 100-200 (avg: 150) |
| Hourly cost | ¥10,000 |
| **Total cost** | **¥1,500,000** |

This is searching databases, reviewing websites, evaluating fit based on experience and gut feel, iterating on client feedback, and often re-doing work when priorities shift—valuable work, but time-intensive and hard to scale.

## The Discovery Chat

One of the most time-consuming parts of partner search is understanding what the client actually needs. The Discovery Chat handles this through guided conversation.

**How it works:**
- AI coach asks strategic questions about the client's business
- Extracts partner type, must-have requirements, success criteria, red flags
- Outputs structured brief ready for search

**Two ways to use it:**

| Option | How | When |
|:-------|:----|:-----|
| **Consultant-led** | Run the chat during client meeting | Standard workflow |
| **Client self-service** | Send chat link to client before meeting | Client prepares in advance, meeting starts with structured brief already in hand |

The self-service option means clients can do the intake on their own time, and your first meeting starts with actionable requirements instead of discovery questions.

---

## The Full Workflow

**1. Discovery** — Guided chat extracts structured requirements

**2. Search** — AI searches databases and web simultaneously, finds obvious and non-obvious partners

**3. Evaluate** — 20 candidates scored on market fit, technical synergy, strategic alignment (weights adjustable)

**4. Refine** — Exclude candidates, adjust priorities, dig deeper—no re-searching needed

---

## Quality Control

Your expertise stays central—but now it's applied to curated candidates instead of raw research:

- **Review** requirements before searching
- **Customize** evaluation criteria and weights
- **Compare** against other tools (Gemini, OpenAI Deep Research)
- **Refine** based on your judgment and industry knowledge

The gut feel doesn't go away—it gets applied where it matters most: evaluating fit, not gathering data.

---

## What Clients Receive

- Company profiles with fit rationale
- Multi-dimensional scores with confidence levels
- Strengths, concerns, next steps
- Transparent, explainable methodology

---

## Next Steps

1. Pick an upcoming client engagement
2. Run PartnerScope alongside normal process
3. Compare results and time spent

---

## Future: Integration with Corundum Data

PartnerScope becomes more powerful when connected to your existing knowledge:

| Data Source | What It Enables |
|:------------|:----------------|
| Past partnerships | "Companies similar to ones that worked before" |
| Client history | Avoid recommending past clients as partners |
| Internal network | Surface warm introductions through existing relationships |
| Deal outcomes | Learn which partner types succeed for which client types |

This turns PartnerScope from a general tool into one that reflects Corundum's decade of expertise and relationships.
