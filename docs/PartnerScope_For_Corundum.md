# PartnerScope for Corundum Corp.

**Scaling Partner Discovery Without Scaling Headcount**

---

## The Challenge

Corundum Corp. has built a decade of expertise in open innovation and venture building. Your team excels at turning early-stage technologies into real businesses through strategic partnerships.

But partner discovery remains a bottleneck:

> *"Corundum Corp. has a customer (e.g. startup) with a business idea, and needs to assist them with finding business partners such as investors, technology providers, or manufacturers. How can they do this in the best way?"*

Today, this means:
- Hours of manual research per client engagement
- Searching multiple databases and websites
- Inconsistent evaluation criteria across team members
- Limited capacity to serve more clients simultaneously

**The question isn't whether your team can find good partners—it's whether you can do it at scale without compromising quality.**

## How PartnerScope Fits Your Workflow

PartnerScope augments your consultants' expertise, not replaces it. Your team remains in control while AI handles the time-intensive discovery and initial filtering.

**Current Workflow:**

| Stage | Today | Time |
|-------|-------|------|
| Client intake | Manual interviews, note-taking | 1-2 hours |
| Partner research | Database searches, web research | 4-8 hours |
| Candidate evaluation | Spreadsheets, gut feel | 2-4 hours |
| Refinement | Re-do research based on feedback | 2-4 hours |
| **Total** | | **9-18 hours** |

**With PartnerScope:**

| Stage | With PartnerScope | Time |
|-------|-------------------|------|
| Client intake | Guided conversation extracts requirements | 10-15 min |
| Partner research | Multi-source AI search | 2-5 min |
| Candidate evaluation | Multi-dimensional scoring | 5-10 min |
| Refinement | Instant re-ranking, no re-search | 1-2 min |
| **Total** | | **20-30 min** |

Your consultants shift from data gathering to strategic advisory—where their expertise matters most.

## Three Ways to Use PartnerScope

### 1. Accelerate Client Engagements

Run a comprehensive partner search during the initial client meeting. By the end of a one-hour session, you have:

- Structured client requirements (automatically extracted)
- 20 ranked partner candidates with rationale
- Multi-dimensional evaluation scores
- Talking points for each top candidate

**Impact:** Deliver preliminary results in the first meeting instead of a follow-up.

### 2. Scale Your Service Capacity

Each consultant can handle more client engagements when partner research takes 30 minutes instead of 8 hours.

| Metric | Before | With PartnerScope |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Research time per client | 8 hours | 30 minutes |
| Clients per consultant/week | 2-3 | 8-12 |
| Time to first deliverable | 3-5 days | Same day |

**Impact:** Serve 4x more clients without hiring.

### 3. Validate and Benchmark Results

Use the comparison feature to validate PartnerScope results against other research methods:

- Run the same query through Gemini Deep Research or OpenAI
- PartnerScope evaluates both result sets with identical criteria
- Side-by-side comparison shows which found better partners

**Impact:** Confidence that you're delivering the best possible candidates.
