# PartnerScope for Corundum Corp.

**Reducing Partner Discovery from Weeks to Minutes**

---

## The Bottleneck

Corundum Corp. has spent a decade building expertise in open innovation and venture building. But partner discovery remains a bottleneck—searching databases, reviewing websites, evaluating fit based on experience and gut feel, and often re-doing work when priorities shift.

**Current baseline:** 100-200 hours per customer (avg: 150) at ¥10,000/hour = **¥1,500,000**

## The Workflow

| Stage | Today | With PartnerScope |
|:------|:------|:------------------|
| Requirements | Manual interviews | AI-guided conversation (10 min) |
| Research | Database + web searches | Multi-source AI search (5 min) |
| Evaluation | Spreadsheets, gut feel | Multi-dimensional scoring (10 min) |
| Refinement | Re-do research | Instant iteration (2 min) |
| **Total** | **100-200 hours** | **Under 1 hour** |

**1. Discovery Chat** — AI-guided conversation extracts partner type, must-haves, success criteria, red flags. Can be consultant-led or client self-service (send link before meeting).

**2. Search** — Searches databases and web simultaneously, finds obvious and non-obvious partners.

**3. Evaluate** — 20 candidates scored on configurable dimensions (weights adjustable).

**4. Refine** — Narrow specifications as results come in. Adjust weights, exclude candidates, run additional searches—build on what you've learned instead of starting over.

## For Consultants

**"What if the AI misses something?"**
You review everything before it goes to the client. The AI generates candidates; you apply judgment.

**"Can I customize it?"**
Yes. Evaluation dimensions and weights are adjustable per client type.

**"What about confidentiality?"**
Client information stays within the session. No data is used to train AI models.

**"Will this make my work less valuable?"**
The opposite. Less time gathering data, more time on strategic advice and relationship building.

## Quality Control

Your gut feel doesn't go away—it gets applied where it matters:

- **Review** requirements before searching
- **Customize** evaluation criteria and weights
- **Compare** against other tools (Gemini, OpenAI Deep Research)
- **Refine** based on your judgment and industry knowledge

## What Clients Receive

- Company profiles with fit rationale
- Multi-dimensional scores with confidence levels
- Strengths, concerns, and recommended next steps
- Transparent, explainable methodology

## Future: Integration with Corundum Data

| Data Source | What It Enables |
|:------------|:----------------|
| Past partnerships | Prioritize companies similar to past successes |
| Client history | Avoid recommending past clients as partners |
| Internal network | Surface warm introductions |

This turns PartnerScope into a tool that reflects Corundum's decade of expertise.
