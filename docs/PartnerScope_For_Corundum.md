# PartnerScope for Corundum Corp.

**Reducing Partner Discovery from Weeks to Minutes**

---

## The Challenge

> *"Corundum Corp. has a customer (e.g. startup) with a business idea, and needs to assist them with finding business partners such as investors, technology providers, or manufacturers. How can they do this in the best way?"*

**Current Reality:**

| Metric | Today |
|--------|-------|
| Hours per customer | 100-200 hours |
| Average | 150 hours |
| Cost per hour | ¥10,000 |
| **Total cost per customer** | **¥1,500,000** |

This is manual, time-intensive work: searching databases, reviewing websites, evaluating fit, and iterating based on client feedback.

## How It Works

**1. Discovery Chat**
Guided conversation extracts structured requirements from the client—partner type, must-have capabilities, success criteria, red flags.

**2. Multi-Source Search**
AI searches both curated databases and live web, finding obvious partners and non-obvious ones the client wouldn't have thought to look for.

**3. Evaluation & Ranking**
20 candidates scored across multiple dimensions (market fit, technical synergy, strategic alignment, etc.) with adjustable weights.

**4. Refinement**
Exclude candidates, adjust priorities, or dive deeper—without re-running the entire search.

## Quality Assurance

Your team stays in control:

- **Review** extracted requirements before searching
- **Customize** evaluation dimensions and weights
- **Compare** results against other AI research tools (Gemini, OpenAI)
- **Refine** rankings based on your expertise

PartnerScope handles discovery; your team applies judgment and relationships.
