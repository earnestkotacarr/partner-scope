## **CoVital — ALife co-regulation companion for loneliness (needs two partners)**

**What they have:**  
A mobile app \+ backend “co-regulation engine” built from artificial-life agents that model **motivation, arousal, and social seeking**. Each user is paired with a swarm-based “inner ecosystem” that responds to their check-ins, speech/text patterns, and basic sensor data (sleep, movement), and gently nudges them toward social contact and self-soothing behaviors.

**Why now:**  
Loneliness is now framed as a **public health crisis**, but most tools are either CBT-style apps or pure social networks. There’s a gap for something **between therapy and social media**: a system that embodies a *living* co-regulator and learns each person’s viable/social zones over time (your ALife schema of motivation & co-regulation).

Startup:L Prototype working, need test and validate 

**Partner 1 (pilot population – big org):**  
 A **university or large employer** with a wellness program (students or young employees with known loneliness/burnout issues).

**Partner 2 (validation partner – institution):**  
 A **hospital / mental health research lab** that can oversee ethics and help design proper outcome measures (e.g., UCLA Loneliness Scale, PHQ-9, sleep metrics).

### **Minimum requirements**

* **Pilot org (population partner)**

  * Can recruit **100–300 participants** over **8–12 weeks**.

  * Has an internal wellness/mindfulness program (email channels, events) to integrate nudges.

  * Agrees to run **pre/post surveys** on loneliness and wellbeing.

* **Validation partner**

  * Has an IRB/ethics process that can be completed in **≤ 8 weeks**.

  * Can provide a **clinical/psych science advisor** to co-design measures and weekly check-in questions.

  * Will help analyze **anonymized outcome data**.

---

### **Info to collect (each candidate)**

* **From population partner:**  
   Monthly mental-health utilization, existing wellness tools, communication channels (Slack, email, app), approval steps & timelines, budget range for pilots, data privacy constraints.

* **From validation partner:**  
   IRB steps & lead time, preferred measurement scales, acceptable data formats, publication interest (can they co-author a paper?), IT/security requirements.

### **Pilot outline**

* **Scope:**

  * Single campus or single company site.

  * 8–12 weeks, app installed on participants’ phones.

  * Participants do **short daily check-ins** (mood, social contact, energy) and receive:

    * Micro-interventions based on their ALife “ecosystem state” (e.g., “you’re drifting toward isolation; here’s a 5-minute co-regulation ritual”).

    * Smart nudges to low-friction social actions (send a message, join an event, short call with a friend).

* **ALife / AI core:**

  * A population of synthetic “needs”/“motives” whose dynamics approximate your **vitality vs viability** schema (e.g., agents for connection, rest, challenge).

  * Local rules update based on **how the user actually regulates** (did they reach out? did they sleep? did they move?), so the system learns their personal co-regulation profile.

* **Deliverables:**

  * Weekly usage & engagement report (check-ins, adherence, response rates).

  * Pre/post comparison on loneliness & wellbeing.

  * A short **“CoVital at \[Org\]”** case study draft and, ideally, an academic abstract.

---

### **Success criteria**

* **≥ 20–30% reduction** in loneliness score (UCLA or similar) vs baseline for regular users (\>4 check-ins/week).

* **Sustained usage:** ≥ 60% of participants still active at week 8\.

* At least **one internal champion** (wellness officer, HR, campus counselor) agrees to a next-phase plan (bigger cohort or integration with existing wellness stack).

* Validation partner green-lights a **joint publication or conference abstract**.

---

### **Red flags**

* Org wants **clinical outcomes without proper ethics approval**.

* No single owner on the org side (wellness, HR, or student life).

* Legal/privacy review with no clear deadline.

* Strong push to turn it into **just another CBT app** rather than keeping the ALife/interaction core.
