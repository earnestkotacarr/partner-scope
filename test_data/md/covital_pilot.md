# CoVital Pilot Partner Search

## Startup Overview
**CoVital** - ALife co-regulation companion for loneliness

A mobile app + backend "co-regulation engine" built from artificial-life agents that model motivation, arousal, and social seeking. Each user is paired with a swarm-based "inner ecosystem" that responds to their check-ins, speech/text patterns, and basic sensor data (sleep, movement), and gently nudges them toward social contact and self-soothing behaviors.

## Partner Type
**Pilot Population Partner (Big Organization)**

Looking for a university or large employer with a wellness program (students or young employees with known loneliness/burnout issues).

## Target Partner Categories
- Universities with student wellness programs
- Large employers with employee wellness/mental health programs
- Student housing and dorm management companies
- Co-living communities with wellness focus
- Organizations addressing loneliness/burnout in students or young employees

## Minimum Requirements
- Can recruit **100-300 participants** over **8-12 weeks**
- Has an internal wellness/mindfulness program (email channels, events) to integrate nudges
- Agrees to run **pre/post surveys** on loneliness and wellbeing
- Single campus or single company site scope
- Communication channels available (Slack, email, app)

## Information to Collect
- Monthly mental-health utilization
- Existing wellness tools
- Communication channels (Slack, email, app)
- Approval steps & timelines
- Budget range for pilots
- Data privacy constraints

## Pilot Scope
- 8-12 weeks duration
- App installed on participants' phones
- Participants do short daily check-ins (mood, social contact, energy)
- Micro-interventions based on ALife "ecosystem state"
- Smart nudges to low-friction social actions

## Success Criteria
- ≥ 20-30% reduction in loneliness score (UCLA or similar) vs baseline
- Sustained usage: ≥ 60% of participants still active at week 8
- At least one internal champion (wellness officer, HR, campus counselor) agrees to next-phase plan

## Red Flags
