# CoVital Validation Partner Search

## Startup Overview
**CoVital** - ALife co-regulation companion for loneliness

A mobile app + backend "co-regulation engine" built from artificial-life agents that model motivation, arousal, and social seeking. Each user is paired with a swarm-based "inner ecosystem" that responds to their check-ins, speech/text patterns, and basic sensor data (sleep, movement), and gently nudges them toward social contact and self-soothing behaviors.
